We are missing an opportunity to support the musical and dance education to our children who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing who need a more customized curriculum that incorporates their mode of communication. These children are missing opportunities to experience the joy of music, dance and expression </P><H1>Our Story</H1><P>In 2016, Julia Faliano and Jari Majewski devised the concept for FTB when working in a multiple needs classroom together and discovered a lack of opportunities for their student population and a need to create more accessible activities.  </P><P>Since starting, Feel the Beat focused on building a community for those who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing where they can learn and experience the art of dance in their native language along with providing an opportunity to connect with their peers.  </P> Feel the Beat welcomes ALL!"
